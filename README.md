### Hello, my name Ruslan Babakian

- I graduated from Bauman Moscow Technical University (BMSTU) and I am Scoltech student right now
- I am studying for a master's degree in Robotics at the Mobile Robotics laboratory.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [crossformer](https://crossformer-model.github.io/) evaluation for navigation robotics tasks
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning multimodal Large Language Models for tobotics field (since i believe that it's future of the AI for robotics)

### List of my projects:

1. [ouster_pedestrian_detector ](https://github.com/RusBabakyan/ouster_pedestrian_detector) - ROS2 node for detecting, tracking and predicting pedestrians position based on Lidar data using DNN YOlOv8 (with full castom dataset)
2. [Text-Auto-Completion-with-classic-Decoder](https://github.com/RusBabakyan/Text-Auto-Completion-with-classic-Decoder) - AutoComplete Application with classic Decoder architecture
2. [Object_Counter_On_Conveyor_Belt ](https://github.com/RusBabakyan/Object_Counter_On_Conveyor_Belt) - An automatic object counting system on a conveyor belt designed for poultry farms. Project includes detection and tracking systems based on the camera, server with visual interface, communication with a remote database
